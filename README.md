## Death Prediction on Coronavirus_Data
- **[Death Prediction on Coronavirus_Data ‚úÖ](https://github.com/fyshark/data_analysis_projects/tree/main/coronavirus_clinical_data_analysis):** The data comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [see data](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/).
- CDC is a USA health protection agency and is in charge of collecting data about the COVID-19 pandemic, and in particular, tracking cases, deaths, and trends of COVID-19 in the United States. CDC collects and makes public deidentified individual-case data on a daily basis, submitted using standardized case reporting forms. In this analysis, we focus on using the data collected by CDC to build a data analytics solution for death risk prediction. CDC collects demographic characteristics, exposure history, disease severity indicators and outcomes, clinical data, laboratory diagnostic test results, and comorbidities. It also includes information on whether the individual survived or not.
- The dataset we work with is a sample of the public data released by CDC, where the outcome for the target feature death_yn is known (i.e., either 'yes' or 'no'):

- There are 4 parts for this project:
  (1) Initial data cleaning and preprocessing and prepare a table with descriptive statistics for all the continuous and categorical features by plotting suitable graphs for visualization.
  (2) Prepare a data quality plan for the cleaned CSV file.
  (3) Exploring relationships between feature pairs (e.g. continuous-continuous feature plots or continuous-categorical plots or correlation plots)
  (4) Transform, extend or combine the existing features to create a few new features to better capture the problem domain and the target outcome.
